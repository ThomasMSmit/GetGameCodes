criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.\r\n\r\nThe biggest, most dynamic and most diverse open world ever created, Grand Theft Auto V blends storytelling and gameplay in new ways as players repeatedly jump in and out of the lives of the game's three lead characters, playing all sides of the game's interwoven story.\r\n\r\nAll the classic hallmarks of the groundbreaking series return, including incredible attention to detail and Grand Theft Auto's darkly humorous take on modern culture, alongside a brand new and ambitious approach to open world multiplayer.\r\n\r\nESRB Rating: M - Mature 17+\r\n\r\nDeveloper(s): Rockstar North\r\nPublishers(s): Rockstar Games\r\n\r\nReleaseDate: 13-04-2015\r\n\r\nGenre(s): Action | Adventure | Sandbox", "price": "9.99", "rating": "4.00", "image_url": null, "image": "gta5_cover_image_theZAMQ.png"}}, {"model": "products.product", "pk": 176, "fields": {"category": 11, "sku": "PSN0001", "name": "GOD OF WAR PS4", "description": "Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.\r\n\r\n• Bold New Beginning — His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew.\r\n• A Second Chance — Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.\r\n• A Darker, More Elemental World — From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise.\r\n• Vicious, Physical Combat — With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.\r\n\r\nESRB Rating: M - Mature 17+\r\n\r\nDeveloper(s): Sony Santa Monica Studio\r\nPublishers(s): Sony Interactive Entertainment\r\n\r\nReleaseDate: 20-04-2018\r\n\r\nGenre(s): Action | Adventure", "price": "15.29", "rating": "5.00", "image_url": null, "image": "gow_cover_image.png"}}, {"model": "products.product", "pk": 177, "fields": {"category": 12, "sku": "XBOX0001", "name": "MINECRAFT XBOX ONE", "description": "Minecraft is a game about placing blocks and going on adventures.
